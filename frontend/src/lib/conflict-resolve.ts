// Single conflict-resolution strategy shared by BOTH resolution surfaces:
//   - merge-controller.svelte.ts save()      (merge view, 3-pane editor)
//   - DiffPanel.svelte quickResolve/saveMerge (diff view, ◀Ours/Theirs▶ + ⧉ Merge)
//
// Before this module the two surfaces had DIVERGENT jj semantics for the same
// user intent ("resolve this file"): the diff-view path silently ran `jj edit`
// to move the working copy onto a non-@ target, while the merge-view path
// resolved in place via `jj resolve --tool`. resolveConflictFile() owns the
// @/non-@/remote decision in ONE place:
//
//   target          | strategy            | moves @?
//   ----------------+---------------------+----------------------------------
//   @ (working copy)| api.fileWrite       | no (it IS @)
//   non-@, local    | api.mergeResolve    | no (jj resolve -r <rev>)
//   non-@, SSH (501)| api.edit + fileWrite | YES — surfaced via the result's
//                   |                      | movedWorkingCopy flag; callers
//                   |                      | MUST show it, never silent
//
// Pure dependency injection — no api.ts import — so the strategy is unit-
// testable and each caller keeps its own race protection (gen counter or
// target-identity comparison) via the isStale hook.
