// Factory for per-file progressive diff derivations (highlights, word-diff
// LCS). Replaces hand-rolled generation-counter + $state + memo-check blocks
// in DiffPanel with a testable abstraction, same as createLoader did for
// async fetches.
//
// The pattern: process DiffFile[] → Map<filePath, R> one file at a time,
// yielding between files so the UI stays responsive. Each run aborts any prior
// run. Completed runs are memoized by cacheKey (commit_id) so revisits restore
// instantly instead of recomputing. Memoization is externalized so multiple
// derivations (highlights + wordDiffs) can share one LRU bucket and evict
// together.
