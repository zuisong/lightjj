// Per-file mutation cluster extracted from DiffPanel.svelte: the inline-edit /
// markdown-preview / 3-pane-merge / quick-resolve state and the async actions
// that drive them. This was the densest hand-rolled async block
// left in the panel — every function carries post-await identity guards,
// per-file busy holds, and (for previews) a generation barrier. Extracting it
// follows the createMergeController precedent: deps injection, documented
// contract, race invariants locked by deferred-promise tests instead of full
// component mounts.
//
// Guard inventory (all preserved verbatim from the DiffPanel inline code —
// see docs/design-notes/frontend-perf.md "Post-await identity guard"):
//   - diffTarget identity guards: every await is a j/k navigation window; the
//     captured changeId is compared against deps.getDiffTarget() AFTER each
//     await, before any state write (stillOn() below).
//   - editBusy holds: per-file concurrency gate — a second op on the same
//     file while one is in flight is a no-op, not a queue.
//   - previewGen barrier: bumped once per bulk clear / identity change to
//     invalidate ALL in-flight per-file preview fetches. Deliberately NOT a
//     createLoader (no single `.value` — it guards per-key Map writes).
//   - mutation lock (deps.getMutationLock): jj mutations route through App's
//     withMutation when present; an `undefined` result means blocked → bail.
//     The `&& lock` on the bail checks is load-bearing: without a lock
//     (test mounts) a mock resolving `undefined` must NOT read as "blocked".
