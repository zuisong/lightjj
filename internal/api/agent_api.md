# lightjj agent API — doc-mode comments & suggestions

lightjj's doc mode lets a human review markdown files with range-anchored
comments and accept/reject text suggestions. Agents interact with the same
comment store via plain HTTP — no ProseMirror, no special client.

This page is served at `GET /api/agent`. A minimal JSON index is at `GET /api`.

## Reaching the server

A running lightjj writes `{pid, addr, port, repo_dir, mode, started_at}` to
`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/lightjj/sessions/<pid>.json` (or
`$TMPDIR/lightjj-<uid>/sessions/<pid>.json` where `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` is unset
— macOS, most servers). To find the instance for the repo you're working in:

```sh
dir="${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR:-${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/lightjj-$(id -u)}"
[ -n "$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR" ] && dir="$dir/lightjj"
jq -r --arg repo "$PWD" 'select(.repo_dir == $repo) | .addr' "$dir"/sessions/*.json
# → 127.0.0.1:54321
```

All routes are tab-scoped: `<base> = http://<addr>/tab/{N}`. Tab 0 is the repo
lightjj was launched in; `GET http://<addr>/tabs` lists open tabs with their
paths if you need a different one. `GET <base>/api/capabilities` returns
`{api_version, jj_version, actions: [...]}` so you can probe for endpoint
availability instead of 404-handling.

lightjj only accepts requests with `Host: localhost` (DNS-rebinding
protection). If the agent runs on a different machine, use an SSH tunnel that
keeps the Host header local:

```sh
# On the laptop running lightjj (forward to the agent's host):
ssh -R 8080:localhost:<lightjj-port> user@agent-host
# Agent then uses <base> = http://localhost:8080/tab/0
```

The doc-mode UI's **Agent hint** button still shows the `<base>` URL for the
open file if you prefer the manual route.

## Read the document

```
GET <base>/api/file-show?revision=@&path=docs/DESIGN.md
→ 200 {"content": "# Design\n\n..."}
```

`path` is repo-relative, forward slashes, no leading `./` or `/`. Use the same
form everywhere — it must byte-match across `file-show` and `doc-comments`.

## Anchor model

Comments and suggestions are anchored by **content**, not line numbers or
byte offsets:

```jsonc
{
  "selection":     "the exact phrase you're commenting on",   // required
  "contextBefore": "up to ~40 chars immediately before it",   // optional, "" at file start
  "contextAfter":  "up to ~40 chars immediately after it"     // optional, "" at file end
}
```

Matching is **lenient on markdown syntax and whitespace**: the characters
`` * _ ` ~ [ ] ( ) ! # > | `` and all whitespace runs are normalized away
before comparison, so anchor against rendered prose and
don't worry about whether `**bold**` or a paragraph break falls inside the
window. If `selection` is unique it lands exactly; context disambiguates
duplicates; if the text was deleted the comment shows as "orphaned". A tied
context score also orphans (rather than guess).

**Anchor against what renders, not what's in the source.** Link/image URLs,
HTML comments, and table pipes are not in the matched text — only link *text*
is. For `[race.png](205-race-a.png)` in a table row, this works:

```jsonc
{ "selection": "Reference",
  "contextBefore": "solves it · race.png" }   // link text ✓
```

and this orphans:

```jsonc
{ "selection": "Reference",
  "contextBefore": "205-race-a.png) | " }     // URL + table pipe ✗
```

## Post a comment

```
POST <base>/api/doc-comments
Content-Type: application/json
```
```jsonc
{
  "id": "c-1",                       // optional — server assigns if omitted
  "filePath": "docs/DESIGN.md",      // required — repo-relative, see above
  "anchor": { "selection": "...", "contextBefore": "...", "contextAfter": "..." },
  "kind": "comment",                 // "comment" | "suggestion"
  "body": "markdown body",           // optional — rendered in the rail
  "author": "agent-name",            // optional — shown next to timestamp
  "createdAt": 1746543600000         // optional Unix epoch ms — server stamps if omitted
}
```

→ `200` with the stored record echoed (including any server-assigned `id` /
`createdAt`). `400` on missing `filePath` or path-escape.

**Upsert semantics**: POSTing an existing `id` replaces the record. The server
preserves an existing `resolution`/`resolvedAt` if your body omits them, so
re-posting to amend `body` won't clear the human's accept/reject.

## Post a suggestion

Same endpoint, `kind: "suggestion"` plus `suggestion.replacement`:

```jsonc
{
  "filePath": "docs/DESIGN.md",
  "anchor": { "selection": "single-binary", "contextBefore": "powerful, ", "contextAfter": " Jujutsu" },
  "kind": "suggestion",
  "suggestion": { "replacement": "single binary" },
  "body": "prefer hyphenless per style guide",
  "author": "agent-name"
}
```

The user sees the selection struck through with the replacement below it and
**Accept** / **Reject** buttons. Accept replaces the text in the live editor
(the file on disk updates when the user clicks Save).

## Batch post

For multiple comments at once, `POST <base>/api/doc-comments/batch` validates
the entire array before writing any (all-or-nothing):

```jsonc
{
  "file_path": "docs/DESIGN.md",
  "comments": [
    { "anchor": {"selection": "..."}, "kind": "comment", "body": "..." },
    { "anchor": {"selection": "..."}, "kind": "suggestion",
      "suggestion": {"replacement": "..."}, "body": "..." }
  ]
}
```

→ `200` with the stamped array (server-assigned `id`/`createdAt` filled in).
`400` with `comments[N].anchor.selection required` if any entry is invalid; in
that case nothing is written.

## Steer the user's view

```
POST <base>/api/navigate
Content-Type: application/json
{"change_id": "wqnwkozp", "file_path": "src/handlers.go"}
```

→ `200`. The connected browser switches to that revision and scrolls the diff
to that file. Use this to walk the user through a review: post a batch of
comments, then `navigate` to the first one. `change_id` and/or `file_path`
required; `line` is accepted but currently ignored. `503` if the server was
started with `--no-watch` (no SSE channel to push through). Ignored if the
user is mid-rebase/squash — they'll see an info toast instead.

## Read back / poll

```
GET <base>/api/doc-comments?path=docs/DESIGN.md
→ 200 [{"id": "...", "resolution": "addressed", ...}, ...]
```

`resolution` is `"addressed"` (accepted/resolved), `"wontfix"` (rejected), or
absent (open). Note: `addressed` means the user accepted in-editor; the change
reaches disk only after they Save, so `file-show` may lag. There is no
"review finished" signal — poll until all your ids have a `resolution`, or
agree a convention with the user (e.g. they post a final comment with
`body: "done"`).

## Threading

Replies set `parentId` to the root comment's `id` and reuse the root's anchor:

```jsonc
{ "filePath": "docs/DESIGN.md", "parentId": "c-1",
  "anchor": { "selection": "...", "contextBefore": "...", "contextAfter": "..." },
  "kind": "comment", "body": "follow-up", "author": "agent-name" }
```

## Delete

```
DELETE <base>/api/doc-comments?path=docs/DESIGN.md&id=<id>
→ 200
```

`id` is **required** (400 if omitted). Deleting a root cascades to its direct
replies.
