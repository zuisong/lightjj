# lightjj

A browser-based UI for [Jujutsu (jj)](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj) version control.

Jujutsu is a powerful VCS with a steep learning curve. lightjj gives you a visual interface to explore your repo's revision graph, view diffs, manage bookmarks, and perform operations like rebase, squash, and describe — all from your browser, driven by keyboard shortcuts.

## Features

- **Revision graph** — pixel-perfect DAG rendered as SVG from jj's graph output, with muted graph palette colors, amber concentric circle for working copy `@`, and dimmed `◆` for immutable commits
- **Diff viewer** — unified and split (side-by-side) modes, collapsible file sections, word-level inline diff highlighting, syntax highlighting via Shiki, context expansion at hunk boundaries
- **Keyboard-first** — `j`/`k` navigation, single-key operations (`n` new, `e` describe, `u` undo, `R` rebase, `S` squash), command palette (`Cmd+K`)
- **Inline rebase** — press `R` to enter rebase mode directly in the graph. Pick source mode (`-r`/`-s`/`-b`) and target mode (`-d`/`--insert-after`/`--insert-before`) with keyboard shortcuts. `j`/`k` to move the destination cursor, `Enter` to execute
- **Squash** — select files to squash between revisions, with keep-emptied and use-dest-message options
- **Bookmarks** — set, delete, move, forget, track, untrack
- **Git integration** — push and fetch with flag validation
- **Multi-select** — batch operations across multiple revisions
- **Operation log** — view jj's operation history
- **Evolution log** — per-revision evolution history
- **Workspace support** — detect and display jj workspaces with badges
- **Revset filter** — filter the revision graph with any jj revset expression
- **Log/Tracked toggle** — switch between full log and remote-tracked bookmarks view
- **Themes** — Catppuccin Mocha (dark) and Latte (light), toggle via command palette
- **SSH remote mode** — proxy jj commands over SSH to work with remote repositories
- **Single binary** — frontend is embedded in the Go binary, no Node.js runtime needed

## Requirements

- **jj >= 0.38** — older versions may lack template/CLI flags the backend depends on
- **Go >= 1.21** — for building from source
- **pnpm** — for frontend development

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
go install github.com/chronologos/lightjj/cmd/lightjj@latest

# Or build from source
git clone https://github.com/chronologos/lightjj
cd lightjj
cd frontend && pnpm install && pnpm run build && cd ..
go build ./cmd/lightjj

# Run
cd /path/to/your/jj/repo
lightjj
```

## Usage

```bash
lightjj                            # serve current jj repo, open browser
lightjj -R /path/to/repo           # explicit repo path
lightjj --remote user@host:/path   # SSH proxy mode (each jj call over SSH)
lightjj --no-browser               # don't auto-open browser
lightjj --addr localhost:8080      # specify listen address
lightjj --no-watch                 # disable filesystem watch + SSE auto-refresh
lightjj --snapshot-interval 10s    # adjust working-copy snapshot frequency (0 to disable)
```

### Working with remote repos

`--remote user@host:/path` proxies each jj command through SSH. This works but is slow — every command incurs a full SSH connection setup (~400ms+ with ProxyCommand configs, worse over WAN).

**Recommended: run lightjj on the remote and port-forward.** This gives you local-quality performance, full auto-refresh, and filesystem watching — the SSH tunnel only carries HTTP:

```bash
# One-off: run lightjj remotely, port-forward to local
ssh -L 3001:localhost:3001 user@host \
  "lightjj -R /path/to/repo --addr localhost:3001 --no-browser"
# then open http://localhost:3001 locally
```

For persistent use, start it backgrounded and keep the tunnel alive with `autossh` or `ServerAliveInterval`:

```bash
# ~/.ssh/config
Host myremote
  HostName host.example.com
  User me
  ServerAliveInterval 30
  LocalForward 3001 localhost:3001

# Then: `ssh myremote "lightjj -R /path --addr localhost:3001 --no-browser"` in a tmux pane,
# or launch on login via the remote's shell profile.
```

**If you must use `--remote` proxy mode**, enable SSH ControlMaster to avoid per-call handshake overhead:

```bash
# ~/.ssh/config
Host host.example.com
  ControlMaster auto
  ControlPath ~/.ssh/cm-%r@%h:%p
  ControlPersist 10m
```

This brings per-command latency from ~400ms down to ~20ms after the first connection. Auto-refresh is disabled in proxy mode (no remote filesystem watch); refresh manually or rely on in-UI mutations which trigger refresh via op-id tracking.

## Development

Two terminals:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Go backend
go run ./cmd/lightjj --addr localhost:3000 --no-browser

# Terminal 2: Svelte frontend (Vite dev server with hot reload)
cd frontend && pnpm run dev
```

Vite proxies `/api/*` requests to `localhost:3000`.

```bash
# Run tests
go test ./...                      # Go backend tests
cd frontend && pnpm test           # Frontend tests (Vitest)

# Static analysis
go vet ./...
```
